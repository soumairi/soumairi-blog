## Quick Start

### Install as a New Site
You can spin up a new install of Statamic along with this Starter Kit all in one command by using the [Statamic CLI Tool](https://github.com/statamic/cli)

```
statamic new mysite statamic/starter-kit-starters-creek
```

Follow the prompts and you'll be up and running shortly.

### Install into an existing site
You can alternatively install Starter Kits into an existing Statamic 3.2+ site by running the following command while inside that install's root directory:

```
php please starter-kit:install statamic/starter-kit-starters-creek
```


### Customizing (optional)

The [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) included in this kit is compiled with [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/) to reduce filesize on any unused classes and selectors. If you want to modify anything you'll need to recompile it.

```
npm i && npm run dev
```

To compile for production again:

```
npm run production
```
